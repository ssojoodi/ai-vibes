# Single-shot prompt with Claude Sonnet 4

```
I have a video feed of a factory production line. The video is of the conveyer belt where finished goods (coffee packages) move towards the warehouse. 

I have a webcam set up on a computer which can run python and other programs. Can you write a program which continuously monitors the video feed and identifies each package and for each package it ensures that a label is affixed on the body? Our challenge is that sometimes the label doesnâ€™t get attached to the package in the centre of the package.
