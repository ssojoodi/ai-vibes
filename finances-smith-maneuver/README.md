# Introduction

Recently, I stumbled on the Smith Maneuver, a strategy for converting Canadian mortgage interest into tax-deductible investment interest. Itâ€™s a powerful idea, but the process and math behind it is less straightforward. I wanted to understand, in concrete terms, how it could impact my own finances over time. So I used 3 different approaches and prompts to have AI help me understand it.

# 1 - create-analysis-xlsx.py
This is a Python script that generates an Excel workbook (`smith_maneuver_scenario_analysis.xlsx`) to analyze different scenarios for the Smith Maneuver. The script:
* Sets up financial parameters like mortgage rates, HELOC rates, investment returns
* Calculates different scenarios with varying financial conditions
* Generates charts to visualize the portfolio value comparisons

# 2 - smith-maneuver-scenario-analysis.html
This is a web-based calculator that helps you analyze the Smith Maneuver strategy. It features:
* Interactive sliders and inputs for mortgage, HELOC, and investment parameters
* Real-time calculations showing tax savings, portfolio growth, and net worth impact
* Visual charts tracking investment growth over time

The calculator helps users visualize and understand the potential financial outcomes of implementing the Smith Maneuver based on their specific financial situation.

# 3 - smith-maneuver-step-by-step-calculator.html
Provides a step-by-step, year-by-year visualization of the Smith Maneuver strategy. Unlike the previous calculator that showed overall results, this one:
* Shows detailed metrics for each year of the strategy
* Includes an interactive timeline where users can step through each year
* Displays animated bar charts comparing mortgage, HELOC, and investment balances
* Breaks down each step of the process with explanations
