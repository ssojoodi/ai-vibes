# Introduction

Today, June 26, 2025 marks 51 years since the first barcode scan on June 26, 1974, at a Marsh Supermarket in Troy, Ohio. 

Barcodes revolutionized retail with faster checkouts and inventory tracking. But its impact extends to asset management, manufacturing efficiency, and global supply chains, keeping the world’s goods moving in a traceable fashion.

IBM’s George Laurer chose not to patent this innovation, embracing an open-source approach. This decision sparked global adoption, proving collaboration drives progress.

I heard about this on my subway commute (of course!) so In honour of the mighty 𝐛𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐨𝐝𝐞, I made a handy app for scanning, tracking and generating new barcodes!

Barcode Scanner and Code Generator

Context: I need a mobile-friendly website which lets me scan a barcode and also create a barcode based on a number I enter. I also need to save barcodes so when I come across a barcode, I can scan and save its code and regenerate it, a library of Barcodes if you will!

Features:
* Barcode scanner which reads and shows the code and allows for saving it.
* Barcode Library (saves codes), tapping a code will take you to the "Show Barcode" page to show it.
* Generate page lets you create a new barcode by typing in the code, it generates the Barcode progressively as you type in the code field
* "Show Barcode": it's like the "Generate" page, but the code is read-only (basically an item from the "Barcode Library")

Tech specs:
* One HTML/CSS/JS file only.
* It must look elegant and mobile-friendly, like the best in class business mobile apps, e.g. Scanner, etc.
* It must work with a mobile phones camera for ease of use.
